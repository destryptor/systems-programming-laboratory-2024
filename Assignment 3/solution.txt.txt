My roll number = 22CS10088

Secret found = 548526



Process: I set guess as all powers of 2 from 2^0 till 2^19 and run the program each time. Whenever 10 was obtained, the corresponding place in the binary secret number was set to 1, since it represents 1 bit closer to the 20 bit secret (hamming distance). Any other value (12 mostly) was set as 0. This gave the 20 bit secret in binary, which was then converted to its decimal form. The guess 0 was used to verify the total number of zeroes in the binary representation of secret.
